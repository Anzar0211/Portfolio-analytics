- \`/api/stocks\`: GET (fetch all stocks)
- \`/api/strategies\`: GET (fetch all strategies)
- \`/api/trades\`: GET (fetch user's trades), POST (create new trade)

## Design Explanation

### Architecture and Technology Choices

1. **Next.js and React**: 
   - Chosen for its server-side rendering capabilities, which improve initial load times and SEO.
   - The App Router in Next.js 13+ allows for more intuitive and efficient routing.
   - React's component-based architecture promotes reusability and maintainability.

2. **MongoDB with Mongoose**:
   - NoSQL database chosen for its flexibility in handling varying data structures.
   - Mongoose ORM provides a structured way to model application data and enforce schemas.

3. **Clerk for Authentication**:
   - Offers a robust, out-of-the-box solution for user authentication and management.
   - Reduces the complexity and security risks associated with building a custom auth system.

4. **Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui**:
   - Tailwind CSS allows for rapid UI development with utility classes.
   - shadcn/ui provides pre-built, customizable components that integrate well with Tailwind.

5. **Recharts for Data Visualization**:
   - A React-based charting library that offers a wide range of chart types and is easy to customize.

6. **Alpha Vantage API for Stock Data**:
   - Provides reliable and up-to-date financial data.
   - Offers both real-time and historical data, suitable for various features of the application.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Modular Component Structure**:
   - Components are designed to be modular and reusable across different pages.
   - This approach enhances maintainability and allows for easier feature additions.

2. **Server-Side API Routes**:
   - Utilizing Next.js API routes to handle server-side logic and database operations.
   - This keeps sensitive operations and data handling separate from the client-side code.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - The application is designed to be fully responsive, ensuring a good user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

4. **Real-time Data Updates**:
   - Implementing real-time updates for stock prices and portfolio values to provide users with the most current information.

5. **Scalable Database Schema**:
   - The database schema is designed to accommodate future features like multiple portfolios per user and more detailed trade information.

### Assumptions and Considerations

1. **User Base and Scale**:
   - The current design assumes a moderate user base. For larger scale deployments, additional optimizations and caching strategies may be necessary.

2. **Data Accuracy and Timeliness**:
   - We assume that the Alpha Vantage API provides sufficiently accurate and timely data for our users' needs. In a production environment, multiple data sources might be considered for redundancy and accuracy verification.

3. **User Expertise**:
   - The application is designed for users with a basic understanding of stock trading and portfolio management. Additional educational resources or tooltips may be beneficial for novice users.

4. **Regulatory Compliance**:
   - While basic security measures are implemented, full compliance with financial regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) would require additional review and possibly external auditing.

5. **Performance Considerations**:
   - The current design may need optimization for handling large portfolios or high-frequency trading scenarios.

6. **Backtesting Limitations**:
   - The backtesting feature uses historical data and may not account for all real-world factors that could affect trading outcomes.

### Future-proofing and Extensibility

1. **API-First Approach**:
   - The backend is structured with RESTful API endpoints, making it easier to develop additional front-end interfaces (e.g., mobile apps) in the future.

2. **Modular Architecture**:
   - The application is designed with modularity in mind, allowing for easier addition of new features or integration with additional services.

3. **Scalability Considerations**:
   - While the current implementation is suitable for moderate use, considerations for horizontal scaling (e.g., database sharding, load balancing) have been factored into the design for future growth.

This design explanation provides insight into the thought process behind the Portfolio Analytics Dashboard's architecture and implementation. It serves as a guide for understanding the current state of the project and considerations for future development and scaling.
